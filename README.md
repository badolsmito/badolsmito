I like pooping myself through stuff unless it's C++, where I like to take things slowly.
No, seriously. I cannot try to seriously learn CSS without getting immensely bored.
C++, even though I'm learning from a book published in 2003, is just so nice.
Taking it slowly is really nice to avoid stress: You actually end up enjoying everything and undersanding it, too!
